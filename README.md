# 🚀 C++ Projects – Systems & Core Engineering

Welcome to **C++ Projects**, a curated collection of **real-world C++ applications** focused on
**systems programming, performance, concurrency, and memory management**.

This repository is designed to demonstrate **practical C++ engineering skills**, not just academic or toy examples.  
Each project reflects scenarios commonly seen in **backend, systems, fintech, and product-based companies**.

## 👨‍💻 About Me

I am an **entry-level C++ developer** with a strong foundation in:
- Data Structures & Algorithms
- Object-Oriented Programming
- Modern C++ (C++11/14/17)
- Low-level memory and concurrency concepts

This repository represents my hands-on learning and
🔹 Multithreaded File Search Engine

A high-performance tool that searches for keywords across multiple files concurrently.

Features

Parallel file processing using threads

Thread-safe output using mutex

Faster search compared to single-threaded approach

Concepts Used

Multithreading

Mutex & synchronization

File I/O

Performance optimization

Build & Run
g++ src/main.cpp -pthread -o search
./search


Test files are included in the test_files/ directory.

🔹 Custom Memory Allocator

A low-level C++ project demonstrating manual memory management and heap control.

Features

Custom heap allocation

Pointer arithmetic

Controlled memory lifecycle

Concepts Used

Heap vs Stack memory

Pointers

Allocation strategies

RAII fundamentals

Build & Run
g++ src/memory_allocator.cpp -o allocator
./allocator
